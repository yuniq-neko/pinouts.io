Pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11 have Hardware PWM Capability. Each pin can only output up to 40mA max. (Only recommended up to 20mA). The total current provided by all pins together can only reach up to 200mA!\nA0 / A1 / A2 / A3 / A4 / A5 #  The Uno board has a total of 6 Analog Input pins provided by a internal ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) These pins mainly serve as Analog inputs, but can be used as standard Digital IO Pins.\nSDA / SCL #  These pins are dedicated to I2C Communication.\nAREF #  Analog Reference. Provides a voltage reference for Analog Inputs.\nIOREF #  Input / Output Reference. Provides a voltage reference with which the microcontroller operates.\nRESET #  Bringing this pin to a logical LOW will cause the microcontroller to reset.\n+3V3 #  This pin provides regulated 3.3V to power components.\n+5V #  This pin provides regulated 5V to power components. (It is possible- but not recommended- to feed 5V in via this pin.)\nVIN #  The UNO board can be powered by 5-20 volts, however Arduino recommends to only use between 7-12 volts. Over this range can make the regulator overheat, and below this range may simply not be enough for the board to run.\n"}]
